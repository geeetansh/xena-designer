  # Update Edge Functions for new tasks/images relationship

  1. Schema Updates
    - No schema changes in this migration
    
  2. Purpose
    - Document steps needed to update edge functions for the new tasks/images relationship
    - The actual updates must be made to the Supabase edge function files
    
  3. Description
    - The edge functions need to be updated to:
      1. Insert image records first
      2. Then update generation_tasks with image_id instead of result_image_url
      3. Keep photoshoot updates as they are now
*/

-- This migration contains no actual schema changes
-- It serves as documentation for the changes needed in the edge functions
-- The following Edge Functions need to be updated:

/*
  1. generate-image/index.ts:
     - When an image is generated, insert it into the images table first
     - Set image_id in generation_tasks instead of result_image_url
     - Continue updating photoshoots directly as before

  2. process-generation-task/index.ts:
     - When a task is processed, insert the image into images table first
     - Use the returned image_id to update the task
     - Continue updating photoshoots directly as before

  3. monitor-batch-tasks/index.ts:
     - No changes needed, it only monitors task status
*/

-- This is a reminder to make these code changes
